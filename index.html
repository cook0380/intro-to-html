        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Graphic design has been a dream job of mine ever since my graphic design teacher and mentor introduced me to it in high school. Despite this, I pursued other avenues at Carleton, getting high grades in my chosen program of Communications and Media Studies. However, through all my studies I knew that the career path I really wanted was in graphic design.
</p>
            <p>In an attempt to balance the two, I started taking art commissions for illustrations, while maintaining a full course load. With many of my clients, I found that they have a hard time expressing what they want in any given art piece.  I worked closely with my clients to grasp the essence of what they want the piece to convey, unlocking their vision for the art, and working to realize their concepts. While I built up a lot of skills in time management and critical thinking, I left the university to join the Algonquin College Graphic Design program, the field I was truly passionate about.</p>
